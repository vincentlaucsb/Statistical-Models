# Statistical Models
This is my personal collection of notes detailing statistical models, including both their theoretical aspects and applications in statistical software (mainly R).

## What's Included
Summaries of statistical models, including:
* Their intended use case
* Relevant mathematical formula (with some bonus derivations!)
* Hypothesis testing procedures
* Model building strategies
* Model evaluation procedures

Also included:
* With positive probability, a non-zero amount of errors

Because this is intended as a personal notebook I don't necessary check to make sure everything is 100% correct.
Please use the references I've cited (or your own) to double check any complicated formulas or derivations.
